Library to control a 8x8 Matrix with a HT16K33 Backpack

With this Library you can control a 8x8 LED-Matrix which is driven by an Holtek HT16K33 IC.
You will find them mostly on Adafruit 8x8 Mini-LED-Matrix Backbacks.

Just create an Object from the Class, Init it and Set Pixels.
Finally you have to Write the Buffer to the Matrix.

Thats it.
