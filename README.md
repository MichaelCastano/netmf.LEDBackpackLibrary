# netmf.LEDBackpackLibrary
Library to control a 8x8 Matrix with a HT16K33 Backpack

With this Library you can control a 8x8 LED-Matrix which is driven by an Holtek HT16K33 IC.
You will find them mostly on Adafruit 8x8 Mini-LED-Matrix Backpacks.

I created this Library for my Netduino running the .Net Micro Framework.
As there is no Netduino specific Code it should run on any other .NetMF Device, too.

Just create an Object from the Class, Init it and Set Pixels.
Finally you have to Write the Buffer to the Matrix.

That's it.
